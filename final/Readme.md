To run with wireless model please follow the following instructionsï¼š
Please compile and run PID.cpp on the LED node with the following commands:
```
g++ PID.cpp -o PID -pthread -lwiringPi
./PID 80800 2000
```
When running the program, '80800' indicates the port number it occupies from the OS; '2000' indicates the wanted brightness. These 2 arguments can be changed.
If you want to change the target brightness value when the program is running, please type in the number directly and press enter.
Please compile and run Sensor.cpp on the sensor node with the following commands:
```
g++ Sensor.cpp -o sensor
./sensor 10.0.0.28 80800
```
'10.0.0.28' is the IP address of LED node, '80800' is the port number of PID program as above.
Please compile and run 
The State.sct is the state machine simulation. Please open it in YAKINDU and run.
Please manully raise the 'dataRead' event to indicate a data is read from the sensor, in order to make the simulation run.
